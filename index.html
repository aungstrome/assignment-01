          Our beloved country Bangladesh is facing a devastating flood while
          suffering from the COVID pandemic and is in urgent need of our help.
          Close to one-third of Bangladesh is underwater, Forecasts predict that
          the country will experience worse flooding in the coming days.
          Already, more than 2.8 million people have been affected, including
          over 1 million who remain isolated and surrounded by floodwaters,
          according to the Bangladesh Ministry of Disaster Management and
          Relief.
